[ ] SIGTERM handler for respawn, currently just the respawn program dies, it *should* also kill its child process
perhaps make it pass along all signals?

[ ] shutdown/reboot/poweroff are always overwritten on upgrade, use different names, use init= parameter instead of
symlinking to init for sinit
